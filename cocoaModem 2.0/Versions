	Brag inserted into wrong place? PSK?  (Can't replicate.)
	Hellschreiber waterfall turns all green? (Can't replicate.)

	NSLock in contest interface to keep the TextStorage static when it is clicked for callsign
	Raw (non-ASCII) print RTTY
	
	Instrumentation
		Measure with time constants on spectrum, expand horizontally
		Oscilloscope
		Generator
